# Twitter_Sentiment_Bot
This is a Twitter bot that calculates tweet sentiment, as well as interact with some features of Twitter. 
This project was created to better understand Twitter's API, and practice interacting and gathering data from it. In addition, I wanted to experience 
with some basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks (i.e. sentiment), so this was done using the TextBlob library for python. This data was then 
outputted into a CSV file. 

Some features of this bot include:
  - Creating a Tweet with text and/or images
  - Following any followers of the main user (me).
  - Liking a select number of tweets in my home timeline 
  - Analyze sentiment of tweets from a keyword(s) search, or from tweets in the home timeline.

More features will be added soon.
